    const prompt = `You are creating training data for a chatbot. The topic is "${validatedTopic}" in the ${domain} domain.

üéØ PRIMARY GOAL: Generate the MOST COMMON ways real users would actually type questions about "${validatedTopic}"

CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS:
1. QUESTIONS section = 5 EXTREMELY COMMON ways users would ask about THE SAME SPECIFIC THING related to "${validatedTopic}"
2. RESPONSES section = 5 different answers that ALL address that SAME specific aspect

QUESTIONS MUST BE:
- The MOST LIKELY phrases users would actually type in a chatbot
- Natural, conversational language (not formal)
- Common keywords users search for
- Simple, everyday phrasing
- Focus on ONE specific aspect and make 5 variations of how people commonly ask about it
- Think: "How would a typical person phrase this question?"

MAXIMIZE MATCH PROBABILITY by using:
- Very common words like "tips", "help", "how to", "advice", "guide", "best way"
- Simple language patterns users naturally use
- Both formal and casual variations
- Question words people actually use

RESPONSES should be:
- 5 different ways to give advice about the SAME thing
- All responses address the SAME specific issue
- NO NUMBERING (no "1.", "2.", etc.)
- Vary the wording but keep the core advice consistent

PERFECT EXAMPLE for "better sleep":
QUESTIONS: (all asking about bedtime routine - the most common way people ask)
better sleep routine
bedtime routine tips
nighttime routine help
how to create sleep routine
sleep routine advice

RESPONSES: (all about creating bedtime routine, just worded differently)
Try establishing a consistent bedtime routine every night.
Create a relaxing routine before bed to signal it's time to sleep.
Develop regular pre-sleep habits that help you wind down.
Having the same bedtime activities each night improves sleep quality.
A consistent evening routine helps your body prepare for rest.

ANOTHER EXAMPLE for "pull ups":
QUESTIONS: (all asking about improving pull-ups - most common phrasing)
how to do pull ups better
pull up tips
improve pull ups
pull up help
get better at pull ups

Now generate for "${validatedTopic}" - pick the MOST COMMON specific aspect users ask about and create 5 natural variations:

QUESTIONS:
[5 MOST COMMON ways users would naturally ask about the SAME specific thing related to ${validatedTopic}]

RESPONSES:
[5 different ways to answer that SAME specific question about ${validatedTopic}]`;
